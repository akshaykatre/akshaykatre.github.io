I am obsessed with building clean, simple solutions for complex data problems.   

<!-- My experience spans across various data roles, from data scientist, to consultant, to analyst, to engineer. My desire to build efficient data piplines began with my experience at [CERN](https://www.home.cern/) during my thesis that covered the [searches for magnetic monopoles at the LHC](http://dpnc.unige.ch/THESES/THESE_KATRE.pdf). 

One of the very first algorithms that I worked on was building a Level-2 software trigger at the ATLAS experiment to build a real-time event selection system.  -->

This is simply a colleciton of my thoughts, learnings, and experiences.
