📊 The Pitfalls of Self-Serve Data & The Importance of Data Literacy!  

In our modern business world, self-serve data platforms are a boon! They empower teams to fetch insights, drive decisions, and create dashboards at their own pace. But, there's a caveat! 🚫
 
Recently, I came across a classic scenario that underscores a common mistake: joining tables of different granularities without proper aggregation. Imagine you have an 'Orders' table (unique at order level) and an 'Order Items' table (unique at item level). If you join them directly without considering their distinct levels, you risk inflating your results, potentially leading to critical business misjudgments.


🔍 Quick Example with Numbers: You have 100 orders. 50 of these orders contain at least one 'Premium' product. Across all orders, there are 220 products sold, with 80 of them being 'Premium'.


Approach 1: 80 Premium products220 total products=36.36%220 total products80 Premium products​=36.36% of products are 'Premium'. 

Approach 2: 50 orders with Premium100 total orders=50%100 total orders50 orders with Premium​=50% of orders contain a 'Premium' product. 

Both numbers seem plausible, but only one truly answers the business question of "What percentage of orders contain at least one 'Premium' product?" The correct answer is 50%.  

The key takeaway? 🗝️ While self-serve data tools democratize access, it's paramount for every user—whether you're in sales, marketing, or finance—to have a foundational understanding of the underlying data structures.
 

Two dashboards might show seemingly accurate results, but remember: while there may be many truths, there's only one right answer. 📈 

Let's champion not just data access but data literacy across our organizations. Because when we all speak the 'language of data', we make better, informed decisions together!
