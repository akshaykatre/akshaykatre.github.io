The Pitfalls of Self-Serve Data 
<!-- & The Importance of Data Literacy!   -->

Self-serve data platforms are a boon! They empower teams and individuals to fetch insights, drive decisions, and create dashboards in an incredibly streamlined manner. However, I still find myself asking the question: "Are we truly making informed decisions?" 
<!-- But, there's a caveat! 🚫 -->
 
<!-- Recently, I came across a classic scenario that underscores a common pitfall:  -->
Not too long ago, I was working on a project where I noticed a classic pitfall:
joining tables of different granularities without proper aggregation. There was an 'Orders' table (unique at order level) and an 'Order Items' table (unique at item level). 

A common metric that was tracked was spend per customer. 

The team responsible for building the dashboard however, had joined the customer table to the *Order* table, and pulled in the spend from the *Order Items*, without considering the distinct levels of each table. This led to inflated results. 

Thankfully this was caught in time, but it could have led to critical business misjudgments.


Unfortunately, the team had joined these tables directly, without considering their distinct levels. This led to inflated results, potentially leading to critical business misjudgments.

<!-- If you join them directly without considering their distinct levels, you risk inflating your results, potentially leading to critical business misjudgments. -->
<!-- 
A quick run-through with example numbers to help illustrate the point:
Suppose there were 100 orders, 50 of which contained at least one 'Premium' product. Across all orders, there were 220 products sold, with 80 of them being 'Premium'.

The question at hand: "What percentage of orders contain at least one 

🔍 Quick Example with Numbers: You have 100 orders. 50 of these orders contain at least one 'Premium' product. Across all orders, there are 220 products sold, with 80 of them being 'Premium'.


Approach 1: 80 Premium products220 total products=36.36%220 total products80 Premium products​=36.36% of products are 'Premium'. 

Approach 2: 50 orders with Premium100 total orders=50%100 total orders50 orders with Premium​=50% of orders contain a 'Premium' product. 

Both numbers seem plausible, but only one truly answers the business question of "What percentage of orders contain at least one 'Premium' product?" The correct answer is 50%.   -->

This is just one simple example, but now imagine when more complex datasets are involved, or in the very near future, when AI is asked to build models on data that may not be correctly structured for it's consumption. 

With the rise of self-serve data platforms, and AI based tools, it becomes incredibly important to ensure that the data is fit for purpose and that the users (or AI) are data literate. 

To avoid such issues in the future, it is critical to have in your organisation:
1. **Data Literacy**: Ensure that the users are data literate. They should understand the data, the context, and the implications of using various data sources.
2. **Data Governance**: Ensure that the data is fit for purpose. This includes ensuring that the data is well documented and that the users are aware of the data lineage.
3. **Data Quality**: Ensure that the data is of high quality. This includes ensuring that the data is clean, accurate, and consistent.
